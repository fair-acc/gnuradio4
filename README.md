# GNU Radio 4.0 prototype

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the GNU Radio 4.0 (GR4) prototype and is currently in a beta state. For production use, 
> please use the GNU Radio 3.X (GR3) version found [here](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio).
> Bug reports related to this beta should be submitted [here](https://github.com/fair-acc/graph-prototype/issues), 
> and bug reports for GNU Radio 3.X should be submitted [here](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues)

GNU Radio is a free & open-source signal processing runtime and signal processing
software development toolkit. Originally developed for use with software-defined
radios and for simulating wireless communications, it's robust capabilities have
led to adoption in hobbyist, academic, and commercial environments. GNU Radio has
found use in software-defined radio, digital communications, nuclear physics, high-
energy particle physics, astrophysics, radio astronomy and more!

## What's New in GNU Radio 4.0?

- **Smooth Transition with Updated GR3 Paradigms**: User-defined blocks and flow-graphs continue to be accessible graphically, through Python, and using C++. Notable simplifications and streamlining have been made to the underlying low-level architecture and design, as described [here](https://github.com/fair-acc/graph-prototype/tree/main/core).
- **Enhanced Data Types**: Support for fundamental data types (i.e. ints, floats, complex numbers) as well as more complex, structured, and user-defined custom types.
- **Simplified Block Development**: Modern C++ and computing standards enable rapid development.
- **High-Performance Signal-Processing**: Significant performance boosts from lock-free buffers, compile-time optimisations, and built-in SIMD & SYCL support.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: An updated scheduling method improves performance and enables user-defined schedulers to balance throughput, parallelism, and latency depending on the application.
- **Recursive Directed Graphs**: Support for basic feedback loops.
- **Broadened Hardware Support**: Ready for CPUs, MCUs, GPUs, and aspirationally FPGAs.
- **Bridging R&D and Industrial Use**: Aims to bridge the gap between academics using GNU Radio for research, hobbyists using it for prototyping and safe operational use by research organizations and industry.
