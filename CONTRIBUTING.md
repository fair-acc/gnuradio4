# Contributing to GNU Radio
:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Open an issue
For bugs, issues, or other discussion, please log a new issue in the GitHub repository.

GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Other discussions
For general "how-to" and guidance questions about using GNU Radio to build and run applications, please have a look at the various
examples or if you cannot find anything that fits your use-case use GitHub's discussions forum.

## Contributing code and content
We welcome all forms of contributions from the community. Please read the following guidelines to maximise the chances of your PR being merged.

### DCO Signing

Any code contributions going into GNU Radio will become part of a LGPL-licensed, open source repository. It is therefore imperative that code submissions belong to the authors, and that submitters have the authority to merge that code into the public GNU Radio codebase.

For that purpose, we use the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](DCO.txt). It is the same document used by other projects. Signing the DCO states that there are no legal reasons to not merge your code.

To sign the DCO, suffix your git commits with a "Signed-off-by" line. When using the command line, you can use `git commit -s` to automatically add this line. If there were multiple authors of the code, or other types of stakeholders, make sure that all are listed, each with a separate Signed-off-by line.

### Communication
 - Before starting work on a feature, check if there isn't already an examples in the 'samples' sub-module.
   If not, then please open an issue on GitHub describing the proposed feature. We want to make sure any feature work goes smoothly. 
   We're happy to work with you to determine if it fits the current project direction and make sure no one else is already working on it.

 - For any work related to setting up build, test, and CI for GNU Radio on GitHub, or for small patches or bug fixes, please open an issue
   for tracking purposes, but we generally don't need a discussion prior to opening a PR.

### Development process
Please be sure to follow the usual process for submitting PRs:

 - Fork the repository
 - Make sure it compiles w/o errors against the current release 'main' branch:
 - Write and add a descriptive/meaningful unit-test-case
 - apply the default code formatter (to minimise future refactoring) 
 - Please check against common sanitizers, the CI/CD pipeline, or similar other QA code checker (N.B. other/further code improvements are welcome)
 - Create a pull request 
 - Make sure your PR title is descriptive
 - Include a link back to an open issue in the PR description

We reserve the right to close PRs that are not making progress. Closed PRs can be reopened again later and work can resume.
